        <p> 
            One of several browsers of the WWW project . The LineMode Browser is suitable for use 
            on dumb terminals, requiring no control sequences except for carriage return and line 
            feed. It is also of course useable from terminal emulators in workstation windows. 
            It can also be used as a text formatter, as part of a mail server, and as a general 
            information retrieval tool. </br>
