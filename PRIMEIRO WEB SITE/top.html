        <h1>General Overview</h1>
            
        <p>
            There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. 
            If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.
        </p>
            
        <dl>
            <dt>by Subject</dt>
            <dd>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.</dd></br>

            <dt>by Type</dt>
            <dd>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know 
                what you are looking for.</dd></br>
        </dl>

        <p>
            If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list.</br>
